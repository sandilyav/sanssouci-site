Sans Souci Website Redesign

Project Charter – Version 2 (Instagram-First Positioning)

Location: Ennore Creek
Primary Market: Chennai
Property: Sans Souci – Waterfront Micro-Adventure & Creator Escape

⸻

1. Background, Scope & Strategic Intent

1.1 Background

Sans Souci is a privately owned waterfront property located approximately 30 minutes from Chennai. It offers:
	•	Kayaking
	•	Paddle boarding
	•	Fishing / Angling
	•	Motor boating
	•	Camping
	•	Waterfront private events

	•	Leverage its “Instagrammable” potential
	•	Encourage repeat visits
	•	Feel dynamic or real-time

1.2 Strategic Repositioning

The redesigned site will reposition Sans Souci from:

“Waterfront Property”

To:

“Chennai’s Most Underrated Instagram-Worthy Micro-Adventure Spot”

Core Identity:
	•	Aesthetic but authentic
	•	Adventurous but safe
	•	Close to the city but emotionally distant from it

The website must feel:
	•	Alive
	•	Dynamic
	•	Youthful but not gimmicky

Primary emotional trigger:

“This will look insane on my feed.”

“This is close enough to do this weekend.”
