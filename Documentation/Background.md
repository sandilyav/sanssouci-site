Sans Souci is my private property which is on the banks of the Ennore Creek.
At the moment there is very little infrastructure there.
There is a nice 40x20ft Shed with a kitchen featuring nice madras tiles roofing.
There are 2 bathrooms - fully shower equipped.
There are 6 kayaks there.
THe place is very scenic but its rustic.
I dont intend to invest in that place until I can generate some foot traffic.
The latest thought is that it can be initially promoted as a photospot for Genz 
and GenAlpha instagrammers.
Kayaking is a definite activity that people can indulge in once they come tothe place. 
There is a good crowd of people who visit the ennore beach nearby.
This website is to drive foot traffic to begin with.
Once there is some visitor activity I will be slowly investing to build out more infrastructure.
So the website needs to present the scenic nature of the property.
And drive home that many things are possible. 
But we have to be careful not to oversell.
Strething the truth a little is ok. But not too much that we cannot deliver once there is an enquiry.
