Sans Souci Website Redesign

Project Charter & Iterative Build Plan

Location: Ennore Creek
Primary Market: Chennai
Property: Sans Souci (Waterfront Micro-Adventure Destination)

The property has strong visual and experiential value but the website does not currently translate that energy into digital engagement.
